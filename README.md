## Return of Tanks


</div>

### Description

Agg, Return of Tanks!!! More tanks, but now in DirectX. Drive around ('j' and 'l' are left and right, 'i' and 'k' and forwad and back, space is fire, and 'y' and 'h' raise and lower your gun.)

The baddies just keep on comin, so try to kill as many as you can before they get you. You might need abit more skill that in the last Tank game, but not much. This is a game to play when you should be doing somthing else...

If you know anything about DirectX, and can put a ZBuffer into this program, then pelase do, and send me a copy, because I havent got any Z ordering on this, so I'm relying on one of you showing me how to make a ZBuffer work.

Anyway, no screen shot, but its just a bunch of tanks going around, shoting at each other...
 
### More Info
 
Well, er, you have to like_ press keys and stuff

You probebly need DirectX 6 or 7

No returns at all. This is completly pointless and time wasting. Only download it if you like usless fun...

If you play it for ages, and keep wacking the space bar, it can go FUBAR, and you have to buy a new keyboard...
